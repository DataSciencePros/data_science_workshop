Relationship between 
beta and return is 

CAPM prediction of a 
return premium per 
unit of beta.

Volatility
 
exposure 
 
is as important as 
value/growth and

The beta of a stock is 
 
a key determinant of 
its weight in a low

Research
 
Why Does the Low Volatility Equity Anomaly Exist
 
Explanations 
include

 

Market portfolio is inefficient
 

Investors focus on pricing of individual securities and treat 
securities within an asset class the same (e.g., large cap stocks), 
not the pricing of total portfolios.
 
 

Institutional and retail emphasis on tracking error
 



-
cap, beta one 
securities needed to track the market.
 
 


 

Investors focus on potential winners and over
-
estimate their 
success in finding such companies. 

 
 


stocks
 

Investors face excessive costs or regulatory restrictions which 
prevent them from borrowing.  Results in the price of high beta 
stocks being bid up, thereby reducing their forward expected 
return.

But when I paint

I see it differently.

Index,
 
representing
 
the

is
 
a

that
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
measure
 
the

market
 
performance
 
of
 
developed

.
 
 
The

consists
 
of
 
the

indices
:
 
 
Australia,

the

presented
 
as
 
the
 
benchmark
 
for
 
the

In
 
August
 
of

changed
 
(retro

back
 
to
 
inception)
 
to
 
the

created
 
in
 
April
 
of
 
2008
 
from
 
the
 
parent
 
index
 
(MSCI

using

July
 
2008
 
the

presented
 
as
 
the

for
 
the
 
US

In
 
August
 
of
 
2008
,
 
the

was
 
changed
 
(retro

Effective

2011
,
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
subsequent
 
methodology
 
changes
 
by
 
the
 
index
 
provider,
 
the
 
benchmark
 
for

to

fees
 
received

The

weighted
 
standard
 
deviation
 
of
 
the

of
